            <p>A lot has been going on with my life recently. I am not referring to a <span class="italic">relationship break</span>.
            I a referring to somethings that I need to settle with within myself.</p>
            <p>In truth, I am more of a person that tends to seek attention from other people and let my ego boast itself out so that I
                feel good about myself. In retrospect, I am person that chases clout in things that he does while others cannot. I like being in the
                spotlight where I stand-out in front of everybody. Deep down, I always ask myself a lot of things and I tend to worry a lot about the future.
                <p span id="inter">Mind: Am I good enough for this? I am worried. I think I am not able to do this type of things. I think
                    this isn't really cut out for me... College? Entrance Exams? I also worried about that, too. I don't want Ateneo to be my TOTGA.
                    I don't want to end up in some university where I will be in the same position for my entire life. I want to be someone great. I want to help the world.
                    I want to change it.

                STI has been quite of a very decent school. Their teaching is a bit mid, but I don't mind it all. My classmates are nice and some of them
                are really good influences. Though, despite having good times, there are always bad times. Like as of right now, there are so many things that I need
                to finish and need to do. Along with that is our upcoming exams. I am very worried about failing my exams. I am really doing very badly in literature and somewhat
                mid-performance for Philosophy and Media Information Literacy (MIL). I am worried by a lot and it's a constant pressure to keep going forward despite lacking a lot of
                motivation. I push myself a lot. I never get any breaks. I feel like the only thing i'm good at is studying mathematics and competitive programming.
                So far, I have a lot to do. Here's a list of an idea.
                <ol>
                    <li>Film</li>
                    <li>Research Proposals</li>
                    <li>Exams</li>
                    <li>Competitive programming</li>
                    <li>Math</li>
                </ol>
