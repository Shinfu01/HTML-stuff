                Have you ever had that spark where you suddenly want to become the smartest person in the world?
                That's what I have been going through the past year, and if I were given the chance to express what it feels like,
                <p id="inter">ME: It gets pretty tiring. I sometimes think to myself that I am not ready for this yet or this isn't mean't for me.</p>
                As of the current moment, I am <span class="italic">mentally drained</span>. Drained from chasing this dream of mine. Chasing 
                both contests (or rather olympiads). I plan on joining both Olympiads this year, <span class="italic">NOI</span> and <span class="italic">PMO</span>.
                Those two dear something to me; It might get me into the college that I want to study at â€” <span class="italic">Ateneo de Manila University</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I haven't really decided what college I want to go to or if I should even go to college. This sucks. I am stuck at a certain point.
                I can't decide between those two.
            </p>
            <p><span id="inter">Oh, and also, if you're wondering what colleges I plan to go to, here are my options:
                <ol id="inter">
                    <li>Ateneo de Manila University</li>
                    <li>University of the Philippines</li>
                    <li>De La Salle University</li>
                    <li>MIT</li>
                </ol></span></p>
            <p>I feel like <span class="italic">MIT</span> is nowhere my reach. I never participated in anything international along side with not
            participating in any contests throughout my academic life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am scared. Really scared about my future. I just don't know when to stop. I need to learn how to stop, but I think thats another word for <span class="italic">
                taking a small break
            </span>... I think.
