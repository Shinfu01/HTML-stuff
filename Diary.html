            Have you ever had that feeling that you suddenly want to engrave your name in history and be like,
            "[Name] was an extraoridnary person. He [invented, created, contributed, etc] [some sort of something]."
            Yeah, those kinds of stuff. Where you compete with yourself, not with anyone, only you -- yourself.

            If I were to be honest, I feel like im not able to do any of that in the entire span of my life.
            I feel like everytime I study about something in particular, a idea comes into my mind <p id="ital1">I need to master this.</p>
