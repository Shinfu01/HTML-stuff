            Have you ever had that feeling that you suddenly want to engrave your name in history and be like,
            "[Name] was an extraoridnary person. He [invented, created, contributed, etc] [some sort of something]."
            Yeah, those kinds of stuff. Where you compete with yourself, not with anyone, only you -- yourself.

            If I were to be honest, it's very exhausting; You want to be great and make yourself useful for once in this world. 
            It feels like you're suffering over and over an endless loop of being smart and being revolutionary 
            (in terms of Technological Renaissace).
