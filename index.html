            This is my first Portfolio. However, this is only the first.
            I will improve later on!

            If you're currently reading this file -- Hello! My name is Shawn.
            Hailing all the way from the Philippines.
            
            As of the current moment, I am learning about HTML and im in my
            1st Senior-year of Highshool. I like to do math, code, and learn
            in so many things.

            Additionally, here is my <a href="https://github.com/Shinfu01" 
            title="My GitHub profile">github</a> profile if you're interested,
            and my <a href="Ink.html" 
            title="Blog Page">blog</a> page, for where I write my thoughts and what I am currently feeling.
