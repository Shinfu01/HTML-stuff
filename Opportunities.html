            <p>
                Earlier today I was doing the pre-assignment that I was assigned to complete in <span class="italic">September 15, 2024</span>.
                If you're wondering, it isn't a school assignment. It's for something else that I am wanting to learn from.
                I had a choice to let the opportunity to go to waste or grab the opportunity to get better at programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon finishing, I didn't get to finish the entire problemset within the 2 hours. Afterwards, I went to facebook to go and check my school's page. When I went to facebook, I was greeted with something that, I, myself,
            have been wanting to join and compete in. The <span class="italic">Philippine Mathematical Olympiad</span> or the PMO.
            I checked the post and saw its a registration form for the school coordinators who wish to send 30 students to join and compete for the PMO.
        </p>
        <p id="inter">ME: Should I send this to my math teacher? Am I even ready to compete for this? I feel like I am not yet capable
            to do such problems. I am only in the introductory-intermediate level of Algebra. I don't know anything about Geometry aside the angle, lines, areas, and circles.
            Combinatorics? I am not that confident with my skills yet along with Number Theory... haha..
        </p>
        <p>
            After checking, I checked my school's page and there was no posts about school tomorrow. I then just went back to the problems and started
            <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/upsolve" style="color: rgb(255, 252, 98); text-decoration: none;">upsolving</a> all the problems
            that I couldn't solve. I was given very easy problems that I could solve. The 1st problem, took me 13 minutes to solve, when in reality, I could solve it
            less than 5 minutes, but my implementation was wrong. Moving to the 2nd and 3rd problem, they were so easy to solve, I only passed through the sample test cases
            and never got them AC'd decrementing my level by 1 (Now 7).
        </p>
        <p>
            Fast forward a few hours, I got help how to solve this problem and asked for some hints, then I upsolved all of them.
            Suddenly, a few minutes go by and someone from the Mathematics discord server replied to my question yesterday about, 'How to get better at problem solving'.
            I was surprised to recieve a tip from someone that all I need is to learn about AMC 8-10 and do competition problems so that my problem solving skills will get better
            overtime by the time I get to participate in the PMO. I asked Sir Wu if doing AMC 8's and 10's will help me prepare better for PMO.
        </p>
        <p id="inter">
            Me: Can the AMC 8 - 10 Problems and Book help me prepare for the PMO also?
            <br><br>
            Wu: Yes, though honestly, I think PMO areas might be a bit of a stretch with no contest math background, this year.
            My personal suggestion is to focus on the coding side for now, then add PMO next year to try to qualify for areas
        </p>
        <p>
            I then had an idea to only focus on the coding part and later particpate for the PMO next year. Maybe along with preparing for the PMO, I might as well
            prepare myself for the coming <a href="The One's Mind.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(255, 252, 98) ;">college</a> entrance exams next year.
            The only thing I hope for boosting my college applications is by competing in the <a href="https://www.NOI.ph/" style="color: rgb(255, 252, 98); text-decoration: none;">NOI</a>
            Finals this year. That's the only thing I am hoping for this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sir Wu stated that the Junior Track would be a good background for me and the person
            who's gonna teach us is <span class="italic">Aldrich Ascunsion</span>. For context, He works at AdMU in the Mathematics Department and he is also a good teacher.
            Hoping to learn a lot from him in this Year Round Training.
        </p>
        <p id="inter">
            TLDR; I decided to only focus on the Coding part and later focus on the Math part.
